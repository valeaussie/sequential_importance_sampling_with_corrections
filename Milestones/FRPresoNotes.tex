\section{State of Research}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{State of Current Work}
    \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{1em}
        \item A first paper on our new Sequential Methodology to reconstruct missing data in evolving systems will be submitted this month to the journal `Statistics and Computing'.
        \item Also, the draft of a second paper applying the above method to a new model for the fire ants has been finalised but needs to be reviewed by the supervisors. The code for this paper is still in the working.
        \item Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6 and part of chapter 2 of the thesis have been completed. These are the main chapters of the thesis as of now, however,
        \item the Introduction and conclusion chapters are still in the works as well as the appendixes. All the chapters of the thesis still need to be reviewed by the supervisors Also, the outline of the thesis might still change.

\section{Motivation}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What problem are we trying to solve}
In our research we are considering A systems that evolves in time, and observations of this system that are precise but only partial. These observations will arrive sequentially in time while the system keeps evolving.

We will want to \textcolor{Fuchsia}{impute the missing observations} for all elements created up to the current time. 

However, the observations we receive can render previously imputed missing values implausible and may even conflict with what has been simulated.

This means that imputed missing values must be corrected each time we receive new data.

Notice that we will not only correct the newly simulated elements in our method, but we will also correct missing values imputed at earlier time steps so that they are consistent with the new observations.
 
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What applications}
Our original motivation was to facilitate the analysis of the Red Imported Fire Ant invasion in Queensland.

Here for detected nests the location can be precisely determined, but there is an unknown number of undetected nests with unknown location.

To infer the current extent of the invasion, we impute plausible locations of undetected individuals. 

But these imputations are only informed guesses, and will require constant correction as new detections arrive. 

In addition, new nests are constantly being produced as the state of the system is constantly evolving.

Reconstructing the history of the invasion is useful for example when we want to understand the validity of an eradication program to plan for future programs.

To handle this kind of problems we introduce a \textcolor{Fuchsia}{new Sequential Importance Sampling  strategy (`SIS with corrections')}, which will allow us to make corrections each time new data is acquired.
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Other applications}
Our method however has applications in other fields for example we might want to understand the evolution of a speciesâ€™ geographic range for non invasive species. 
    
We can also think of applications in bush fire modelling, imaging and signal reconstruction and even crime detection. 

Another important application would be in infectious disease modelling. For example when we have farm animals that might carry a disease and the movements of goods and animals between farms can spread that disease to other farms.
\end{frame}





\section{Existing methods}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Existing methods}
 We know that missing data can reduce the statistical power of a study and can produce biased estimates leading to invalid conclusions. Data-sets with missing elements are very common in many fields and so many solutions to overcome this problems are used and many are continuously presented.
 
 Rubin first described and divided the types of missing data according to the assumptions based on the reasons for the missing data. MCAR being missing completely at random, MAR being missing at random (the missing data mechanism does not depend on the underlying systems) and MNAR being missing not at random.
 
Common methods are row deletions where we omit the cases with missing data or the use of mean to impute missing data. These methods are not really good as we get biased estimations if data is not missing completely at random.
        
Better methods are Expectation Maximization, Data augmentation and multiple imputation, but these methods don't make use past observations and the state transition equation so we can improve also on those.

More recent methods have been presented like the Multiple Imputation Particle Filer for Markov models introduced by Giang (Zhang) and the construction of bridges between between last and next observations using a the Sequential Monte Carlo method introduced by Del Moral and Murray.

\section{Our method: SIS With Corrections}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{SIS With Corrections: the variables}
    Consider an $M$-dimensional system evolving in \textcolor{Fuchsia}{discrete time}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \textcolor{PineGreen}{states of this system} at times $t = 1, \dots, T$ are represented by random vectors $\bm{x}^t = (x^t_1, \dots, x^t_M) \in \Real^M$ defined on a probability space $(\Omega, \F, \P)$. So, the \textcolor{PineGreen}{trajectory of the system} up to time $t$ is represented by a random matrix $\bm{X}^t = (\bm{x}^1, \ldots, \bm{x}^t)$. 
        \item Our \textcolor{PineGreen}{state of knowledge of the trajectory} of the system up to time $t$ is represented by a random binary matrix $\bm{b}^t = (b^t_{im}) \in 2^{t \times M}$, where $b^t_{im} = 1$ if the value of $x^i_m$ is known by time $t$, and $b^t_{im} = 0$ if the value of $x^i_m$ is still unknown at time $t$. We also define $\bm{B}^t = (\bm{b}^1,\ldots,\bm{b}^t)$.
        \item We define an \textcolor{PineGreen}{observation matrix} $\bm{z}^t = (z^t_{im})$, where $z^t_{im} = x^i_m$ if $b^t_{im} = 1$, and $z^t_{im} = -$ if $b^t_{im} = 0$. The symbol `$-$' is used to represent an unknown system coordinate. We also define $\bm{Z}^t = (\bm{z}^1,\ldots,\bm{z}^t)$.
    \end{itemize}
Observations are without error so are determined by $\bm{X}^t, \bm{B}^t$. 

We therefore define a function $\sigma_t: \Real^{t \times M} \times \left( \prod_{i=1}^t 2^{i \times M} \right) \rightarrow \prod_{i=1}^t (\Real \cup \{ - \})^{i \times M}$ such that \textcolor{Fuchsia}{$\bm{Z}^t = \sigma_t(\bm{X}^t, \bm{B}^t)$}.
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{SIS With Corrections: at time $t=1$}
    At time $t=1$, our knowledge of the system is represented by a prior distribution with density $q(\bm{X}^1, \bm{B}^1)$ on $\Omega_1 = \Real^M \times 2^M$ and \textcolor{PineGreen}{the posterior distribution} after observing $\bm{Z}^1$ has a density on $\Omega_1' = \sigma^{-1}(\bm{Z}^1)$ given by:
    \begin{equation*}
        p(\bm{X}^1, \bm{B}^1 |\bm{Z}^1) = \frac{q(\bm{X}^1, \bm{B}^1)} {r(\bm{z}^1)} 
    \end{equation*}
    where
    \begin{align*}
        r(\bm{z}^1)  &= \int_{\Omega_1'} q(\bm{X}^1, \bm{B}^1) \prod_{ \{m \in \{1, \ldots, M \} : z^1_{1m} = - \} } \D x^1_m.
    \end{align*}
    \textcolor{PineGreen}{Note that the preceding equation integrates over the elements of $\bm{X}^1$ that are not determined by $\bm{Z}^1$}.
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{SIS With Corrections: at time $t \geq 2$}
    similarly at time $t \geq 2$ our knowledge of the trajectory of the system at time $t \geq 2$, before we acquire the next observation matrix $\bm{z}^t$, is represented by a prior distribution with density $q(\bm{X}^t, \bm{B}^t | \bm{Z}^{t-1})$ on the subspace $\Omega_t = \sigma^{-1}(\bm{Z}^{t-1}) \times \Real^M \times 2^{t \times M}$. After observing $\bm{z}^t$, certain pairs $(\bm{X}^t, \bm{B}^t)$ with non-zero prior density will be incompatible with the new observations, and the posterior density must therefore restrict $(\bm{X}^t, \bm{B}^t)$ to $\Omega_t' = \sigma^{-1}(\bm{Z}^t)$. The posterior density over $\Omega_t'$ must therefore be
    \begin{equation*}
        p(\bm{X}^t, \bm{B}^t |\bm{Z}^t) = \frac{q(\bm{X}^t, \bm{B}^t | \bm{Z}^{t-1})}{r(\bm{z}^t | \bm{Z}^{t-1})} 
    \end{equation*}
    where
    \begin{align*}
        r(\bm{z}^t | \bm{Z}^{t-1})  &= \int_{\Omega_t'} q(\bm{X}^t, \bm{B}^t | \bm{Z}^{t-1}) \prod_{ \{ i \leq t, m \in \{1, \ldots, M \} : z^t_{im} = - \} } \D x^i_m.
    \end{align*}
    Note that the preceding equation integrates over the elements of $\bm{X}^t$ that are not determined by $\bm{Z}^t$. Thus $r(\bm{z}^t | \bm{Z}^{t-1})$ is the integral of $q(\bm{X}^t, \bm{B}^t | \bm{Z}^{t-1})$ over $\Omega_t'$.
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{SIS With Corrections: Markovian Systems}
    We focus on \textcolor{Fuchsia}{Markovian systems}. 
   
    Let $f(\bm{x}^t | \bm{x}^{t-1})$ be the transitional density distribution characterising the system. 
   
    In general for $t \geq 2$ we have:
    \begin{align*}
        &(\bm{x}^t | \bm{x}^{t-1}) \sim f_t(\bm{x}^t | \bm{x}^{t-1})\\
        &(\bm{b}^t | \bm{x}^t, \bm{b}^{t-1}) \sim g_t(\bm{b}^t | \bm{x}^t, \bm{b}^{t-1})
    \end{align*}
    with densities of the initial states $f_1(\bm{x}^1)$ and $g_1(\bm{b}^1 | \bm{x}^1)$.
    The joint prior distribution for $(\bm{X}^t,\bm{B}^t)$ when $t=1$ is given by 
    \begin{equation*}
    q(\bm{X}^1,\bm{B}^1) = f(\bm{x}^1)g(\bm{b}^1 | \bm{x}^1)
    \end{equation*}
    and when $t \geq 2$: 
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        q(\bm{X}^t, \bm{B}^t | \bm{Z}^{t-1}) &=& f(\bm{x}^t | \bm{x}^{t-1}) g(\bm{b}^t | \bm{x}^t, \bm{b}^{t-1}) p(\bm{X}^{t-1}, \bm{B}^{t-1} | \bm{Z}^{t-1}) \\
        & = & \frac{f(\bm{x}^1)g(\bm{b}^1 | \bm{x}^1)}{r(\bm{z}^1)} \prod_{i=2}^{t-1} \frac{f(\bm{x}^i | \bm{x}^{i-1}) g(\bm{b}^i | \bm{x}^i, \bm{b}^{i-1})}{r(\bm{z}^i | \bm{Z}^{i-1})} \\
        & & \times f(\bm{x}^t | \bm{x}^{t-1}) g(\bm{b}^t | \bm{x}^t, \bm{b}^{t-1})
    \end{eqnarray*}
    on the space $\Omega_t$, and the joint posterior distribution on $\Omega_t'$ is given by:
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        p(\bm{X}^t, \bm{B}^t | \bm{Z}^t) 
        & = & \frac{f(\bm{x}^1)g(\bm{b}^1 | \bm{x}^1)}{r(\bm{z}^1)} \prod_{i=2}^t \frac{f(\bm{x}^i | \bm{x}^{i-1}) g(\bm{b}^i | \bm{x}^i , \bm{b}^{i-1})}{r(\bm{z}^t | \bm{Z}^{t-1})} 
    \end{eqnarray*}
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{SIS With Corrections: approximation of the posterior}
    We want to approximate the distribution $p(\bm{X}^{t}, \bm{B}^{t} | \bm{Z}^{t})$ by iterative sampling, and thus obtain Monte Carlo estimates of expectations of the form:
    \begin{align*}
        &E_{p} \Big[l(\bm{X}^{t}, \bm{B}^{t} ) \Big| \bm{Z}^{t} \Big] = \\
        &\int_{\Omega_t'} l(\bm{X}^{t}, \bm{B}^{t})\; p(\bm{X}^{t}, \bm{B}^{t} | \bm{Z}^{t})\; \prod_{ \{ i \leq t, m \in \{1, \ldots, M \} : z^t_{im} = - \} } \D x^i_m
    \end{align*}
    for functions $l: \Omega_t' \rightarrow \Real$. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We take a sequential importance sampling approach, at each iteration using a collection of weighted particles to approximate $p(\bm{X}^{t-1}, \bm{B}^{t-1} | \bm{Z}^{t-1})$.
        \item We evolve these particles under the model to create a new set of weighted particles representing the prior for iteration $t$, namely $q(\bm{X}^{t}, \bm{B}^{t} | \bm{Z}^{t-1})$.
        \item We then modify these particles to be consistent with the observations $\bm{Z}^{t}$, and adjust the weights to ensure the resulting weighted particles provide unbiased importance sampling estimates of an expectation $E_{p}[l(\bm{X}^{t}, \bm{B}^t) | \bm{Z}^t]$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{SIS With Corrections: why we need corrections}
    Consider a particle $(\bm{X}^{t-1}_j,\bm{B}^{t-1}_j)$ constructed at time point $t$, for $j = 1, \ldots, n$, where $n$ is a fixed number of particles.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We generate $\bm{x}^t_j$ for this particle by sampling from $f(\bm{x}^t | \bm{x}^{t-1}_j)$.
        \item Similarly, we generate $\bm{b}^{t}_j$ for this particle by sampling from $g(\bm{b}^{t} | \bm{x}^t_j, \bm{b}^{t-1}_j)$.
        \item The new matrix of observations $\bm{z}^{t}$ is typically inconsistent with a particle $(\bm{X}^{t}_j, \bm{B}^{t}_j)$ thus constructed, in two ways:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item the coordinates at which $\bm{b}^{t}_j$ contains a 0 may not correspond to the coordinates at which $\bm{z}^{t}$ contains a `$-$' and coordinates at which $\bm{b}^{t}_j$ contains a 1 may not correspond to an observation in $\bm{z}^{t}$.
            \item The observed values in $\bm{z}^{t}$ may differ from the corresponding coordinates of $\bm{X}^{t}_j$.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
    
    
    
    
    
    
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{SIS With Corrections: deterministic corrections}
    We must therefore correct $\bm{X}^{t}_j$ and $\bm{b}^{t}_j$ in light of the new observations $\bm{z}^{t}$. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Replace $\bm{b}^{t}_j$ with the unique binary vector $(\bm{b}_j')^{t}$ that is consistent with $\bm{z}^{t}$.
        \item Replace the coordinates of $\bm{X}^{t}_j$ with the corresponding coordinates of $\bm{z}^{t}$ wherever $(\bm{b}_j')^{t}$ has a `1', thus generating a corrected term $\bm{(X')}^{t}_j$.
    \end{itemize}  
    The corrections made at time point $t$ will be carried forward into the particles used at all future times. 
    We use deterministic corrections in which the simulated pair $\bm{y}^{t} = (\bm{X}^{t}, \bm{B}^{t}) \in \Omega_t$ can be corrected in only one way to produce a new element $\bm{(y')}^{t} = (\bm{(X')}^t, \bm{(B')}^t) \in \Omega_t'$, that is
    \begin{equation*}
        \bm{(y')}^{t} = \rho(\bm{y}^{t},\bm{Z}^{t})
    \end{equation*}
    for some function $\rho$.
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{SIS With Corrections: Auxiliary variable}
    At each iteration, in order to simulate via a two-step process in which we generate a sample and then correct in light of data, we propose to use an auxiliary variable in the following manner.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The auxiliary variable will be the yet to be corrected sample $\bm{y}^{t}$, which is an element of the space $\Omega_t$.
        \item We will use a projection map $\pi$ to relate the augmented space $\Omega^*_t = \Omega_t \times \Omega_t'$ containing elements of the form $(\bm{y}^{t}, \bm{(y')}^{t})$ to the corrected state space $\Omega_t'$ containing elements of the form $\bm{(y')}^{t}$.
        \item Our strategy is to define a probability density $p^*$ on $\Omega^*_t$, such that the marginal density of $p^*$ on $\Omega_t'$ is $p$.
        \item Similarly, we define a density $q^*$ on $\Omega^*_t$, such that the marginal density of $q^*$ on $\Omega_t$ is $q$.
        \item We then use a sequential importance sampling approach to re-weight a sample of particles used for Monte Carlo estimation with respect to $q^*$, so that they can be used for Monte Carlo estimation with respect to $p^*$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{SIS With Corrections: $p^*$ and $q^*$}
    A key identity (see proof in appendix) underlying this strategy is the following.
    \begin{equation*}
        E_{p}[l(\bm{(y')}^{t})]  =  E_{p^*}[l(\pi (\bm{y}^{t}, \bm{(y')}^{t})]
    \end{equation*}
    In this equation, the expectation on the left is over $\Omega_t'$, whereas the expectation on the right is over $\Omega_t^*$.
    
    Here we are here interested in a deterministic correction, so we define both $p^*$ and $q^*$ on a subspace of $\Omega_t^*$ consisting of points of the form $(\bm{y}^{t}, \rho(\bm{y}^{t}, \bm{Z}^{t}))$.
    
    Since $\bm{y}^{t}$ determines $\bm{(y')}^{t}$, but the reverse is not necessarily true, the new densities are of the form:
    \begin{align*}
        q^*(\bm{y}^{t},\bm{(y')}^{t}) &= q(\bm{y}^{t} | \bm{Z}^{t-1}), \mbox{ and } \\
        p^*(\bm{y}^{t},\bm{(y')}^{t}) &= u(\bm{y}^{t} | \bm{(y')}^{t}) p(\bm{(y')}^{t} | \bm{Z}^{t})
    \end{align*}
    where $\bm{(y')}^{t} = \rho(\bm{y}^{t}, \bm{Z}^{t})$. Here $u$ is the density of some distribution over the set $F(\bm{(y')}^{t}) = \{ \bm{y} \in \Omega^t  :  \rho(\bm{y}, \bm{Z}^{t}) = \bm{(y')}^{t}\}$.
    The set $F(\bm{(y')}^{t})$ contains all elements of the uncorrected space that can be corrected to $\bm{(y')}^{t}$.
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{SIS With Corrections: the distribution $u$}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The density $u$ must ensure $\esssupp(p^*) \subseteq \esssupp(q^*)$, (a requirement for valid importance sampling (\cite{Geweke})).
        \item Here we consider $u$ to be the uniform density on a bounded (to ensure integrability) subset of $F(\bm{(y')}^{t})$.
        \item If the bounded set is a hyper-rectangle, with each undetermined coordinate of $\bm{y}^{t}$ bounded independently of the others, the normalising constant of $u$ depends on the number of the newly observed coordinates $k$, but is otherwise independent of $\bm{(y')}^{t}$.
        \item If the simulated element $\bm{y}^t$ is outside this hyper-rectangle, then $u(\bm{y}^t) = 0$, and this will result in zero-weighted particle. However, bounds can be set large enough that zero-weighted particles occur only infrequently.
    \end{itemize}
       
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{SIS With Corrections: The weights}
    Applying importance sampling on the probability space $\Omega^*$ we have
    \begin{align*}
        E_{p^*}[l(\pi (\bm{(y')}^{t}, \bm{y}^{t})] 
        \approx \sum_{j=1}^n  w^{t}_j l((\bm{y}'_j)^{t})
    \end{align*}
    where the weights are given by:
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        w^{t}_j &\propto& \frac{p^*(\bm{y}_j^{t}, (\bm{y}_j')^{t} | \bm{Z}^{t})} {q^*(\bm{y}_j^{t}, (\bm{y}_j')^{t} |\bm{Z}^{t-1})} \\
        &=& \frac{u(\bm{y}_j^{t} | (\bm{y}_j')^{t}, \bm{Z}^{t})}{r(\bm{z}^{t} | \bm{Z}^{t-1})} \frac{q((\bm{y}_j')^{t} | \bm{Z}^{t-1})}{q(\bm{y}_j^{t} | \bm{Z}^{t-1})} \\
        & \propto & u(\bm{y}_j^{t} | (\bm{y}_j')^{t}, \bm{Z}^{t}) \prod_{i=1}^{t} w^{t}_{ij}
    \end{eqnarray*}
    with
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        w^{t}_{1j} &=& \frac{f((\bm{x}_j')^1)}{f(\bm{x}_j^1)} \frac{g((\bm{b}_j')^1 | (\bm{x}_j')^1)}{g(\bm{b}_j^1 | \bm{x}_j^1)}
    \end{eqnarray*}
    and the weights for all the subsequent times will be
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        w^{t}_{ij} &=& \frac{f((\bm{x}_j')^i | (\bm{x}_j')^{i-1})}{f(\bm{x}_j^i | \bm{x}_j^{i-1})} \frac{g((\bm{b}_j')^i | (\bm{x}_j')^i, \bm{b}_j^{i-1})}{g(\bm{b}_j^i | \bm{x}_j^i, \bm{b}_j^{i-1})}
    \end{eqnarray*}
    \textcolor{Red}{Notice that the terms $u$ and $r$ will cancel after normalisation.}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{SIS With Corrections: Notes}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We can simplify the model for observations that are \textcolor{PineGreen}{MAR (missing at random)} (i.e. $\bm{B}^t$ evolves independently of $\bm{X}^t$) (see appendix).
        \item \textcolor{PineGreen}{The density $u$ is arbitrary} and we can choose it so that we don't have zero-weighted particles (see appendix).
        \item We have 3 applications for this new model: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item an \textcolor{PineGreen}{AR(1) model},
            \item a \textcolor{PineGreen}{river invasion},
            \item the \textcolor{PineGreen}{RIFA invasion} in Queensland.
        \end{itemize}
        In the first two examples observations are simulated from the system's model.
        \item In the RIFA application the \textcolor{PineGreen}{corrections will not be deterministic}.
        \item The RIFA model is \textcolor{PineGreen}{time-continuous}.
    \end{itemize}

\section{Application: A simple AR(1) Model}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Application to an AR(1) Model}
    \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{2em}
        \item The model we have chosen for the first application is a Gaussian, linear and stationary AR(1) model with missing observations.
        \item For every particle $i$, the unnormalised weights at time $t$ for $b' \in \{0,1\}$ and $b \in \{0,1\}$ are calculated with the following formula
        \end{itemize}
    \begin{align*} \label{eq:2}
        &\frac{q(\bm{(X')}^{t} | \bm{Z}^{t-1}) }{q(\bm{X}^{t} | \bm{Z}^{t-1})} =
        \frac{\bigg \{ \prod_{s=2}^{t}  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^{2}}} \exp \bigg [ { - \frac{1}{2 \sigma^{2}} }  (x'_s - \varphi x'_{s-1})^{2} \bigg ] \bigg \} }{\bigg \{ \prod_{s=2}^{t}  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^{2}}} \exp \bigg [ { - \frac{1}{2 \sigma^{2}} }  (x_s - \varphi x_{s-1})^{2} \bigg ] \bigg \} } \nonumber, \\
        &\frac{p^{b'_t} (1 - p)^{1-b'_t}  }{ p^{b_t} (1 - p)^{1-b_t} }

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{The Analytical Solutions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In the AR(1) model with missing values, we use the last and the next existing observation and the definition of the model to evaluate analytically the missing data.

\section{Application: A River Invasion}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{A River Invasion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item One-dimensional environment without tributaries or confluences. 
        \item The length of the river is divided into $N$ sections.
        \item The first introduction of the invasive species occurs in a cell with index $m$.
        \item The invasion can propagate only in the immediately adjacent sections of the river, (cells indexed by $m-1$ and $m+1$).
        \item At each time step, a cell becomes infested from an adjacent infested cell with probability $\theta$.
        \item Observations are made by a a probe that checks only the unobserved cells adjacent to cells where the invasive species has been detected.
        \item If that cell is both invaded and observed, adjacent cells will also be probed, and so on until a cell in which no invaders are detected is found.  The probability of observing invaders in an infested cell is denoted $\varphi$.
        \item The probe might fail to observe an invader that is present, and hence searching may stop without finding all invaded cells.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Application to the River Invasion}

Similarly to the AR(1) model, since our corrections are deterministic, the unnormalised weights are calculated as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{q(\bm{(X')}^{t}_i,\bm{(z')}^{t}_i | \bm{Z}^{t-1})}{q(\bm{X}^{t}_i,\bm{z}^{t}_i | \bm{Z}^{t-1})}
\end{equation*}

where the primed are the corrected terms and where
\begin{align*}
    & q(\bm{X}^{t},\bm{z}^{t} | \bm{Z}^{t-1}) =  \prod_{i=2}^{t} \varphi^{(a^{i} - a^{i-1})}\bigg(1 - \varphi \bigg)^{1-\one {a^i=\gamma^i}} \nonumber \\
    & \varphi^{(c^{i} - c^{i-1})} \bigg(1 - \varphi\bigg)^{1-\one {c^i=\beta^i}} \; \prod_{i=2}^{\min\{t,r\}} \theta^{k_i} (1-\theta)^{1-k_i}  \label{eq:4} \\ 
    & \prod_{i=2}^{\min\{t,l\}} \theta^{h_i} (1-\theta)^{1-h_i} \nonumber,
\end{align*}
and a there is a similar expression for the primed terms.

Here $l$ is the time at which the invasion has reached the left end of the modelled region, $r$ is the time at which the invasion has reached the right end of the modelled region, $k_i \in \{0,1\}$ and $h_i \in \{0,1\}$ where $k_i$ is 1 if the invasion expanded one cell to the right at time $i$ and $h_i$ is 1 if the invasion expanded one cell to the left at time $i$.

    \frametitle{The RIFA invasion Model}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We aim to design a \textcolor{PineGreen}{model that can be adapted to any type of problems where control strategies will have to be decided rapidly as new data is acquired}.
        \item  \textcolor{PineGreen}{The real spread of the RIFA invasion is unknown} and this makes planning effective eradication programs difficult.
        \item \textcolor{PineGreen}{The history of the invasion is also only partially known}, and determining the real effects of past eradication efforts can be hard.
        \item \cite{Keith} proposed an agent-based model for the RIFA invasion focused on reconstructing the historical trajectory of the invasion to determine if the eradication strategy then applied was successful.
        \item In our new approach we are seeking to \textcolor{PineGreen}{simplify and improve on Keith and Spring model} with the aim to reduce the running time without compromising on flexibility and completeness
        \item A key feature of our model is that \textcolor{PineGreen}{we does not need to include the phylogeny of the nests in} (but the phylogeny can can be reconstructed if needed).
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{RIFA Model: the intensity function}
    Here we consider a self-exciting spatial-temporal point process $N$ as a generalization of an Hawkes model \cite{Hawkes71}. We can then specify an intensity function $\lambda(x, y, t)$ which represents the infinitesimal expected  rate of events at time $t$ and location $(x, y)$.
    \begin{equation*}
        \lambda(x, y, t) = \mu(x, y, t) + \int_{0}^{t} \iint_{S} g(x - x', y - y', f - f') \d N(x', y', f')
    \end{equation*}
    where $\mu$ is the background term and $g$ is the clustering density.
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{RIFA Model: the intensity function}
    We will consider the background to be zero, and we will consider the time and space elements of the clustering density to be independent.
    \begin{equation*}
        \lambda(x, y, f) = \int_{0}^{f} \iint_{S} r(f-f') l\Big((x - x'), (y - y')\Big) \d N(x', y', f')
    \end{equation*}
    where $r$ and $l$ are the triggering functions for time and space respectively.

    Since N is a counting measure, we can write this equation as

    \begin{equation*}
        \lambda(x, y, f) = \sum_{ p: f_p < f } r(f - f_p) l \Big((x - x_p),(y - y_p) \Big)
    \end{equation*}
    where the sum is over all the $p$ parent nests $(x_p, y_p, f_p)$ with $t_p < t$.
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
\frametitle{RIFA Model: Maturation time}
    Each parent nest will be able to found more than one nest, with the number of nests founded per nest per month being a parameter $\zeta$, therefore the temporal triggering kernel will be a step function. Also the nests will have a maturation time $t_m$ of 8 months, meaning that before this time they will not be able to produce new nests. 

    The step function will be:
    \begin{equation*}
        r (f - f_p | \zeta) =
        \begin{cases}
            0, & \mbox{if} \quad f - f_p < t_{m} \\
            \zeta, & \mbox{if} \quad f - f_p \geq t_{m}
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    where $f$ is the founding time of the new nest and $f_p$ is the founding time of the parent nest.
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
\frametitle{RIFA Model: Jumps}
    Biological invasions spread through \textcolor{PineGreen}{local movements} and by \textcolor{PineGreen}{long-distance jumps (\cite{Suarez})}. We will therefore consider two unknown founding types: a local founding event with $U_i = 0$ and the long-distance jump with $U_i = 1$. The vector of jump type is therefore $U = (U_1, \dots, U_N)$ with $N$ the total number of founded nests and will have probability density function

    \begin{equation*}
        p(U| \gamma ) = {N \choose \nu}(\gamma)^{2\nu}(1 - \gamma)^{2(N - \nu)}
    \end{equation*}
    where $\gamma$ is the probability of a long jump and $\nu$ is the number of long-distance jumps.
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{RIFA Model: Jumps}
    The radial distance of the new nests from the parent nest will be \textcolor{PineGreen}{distributed exponentially for the local founding event} and with a \textcolor{PineGreen}{L\'evy distribution for the long-distance jumps}. \textcolor{PineGreen}{The distribution over the angular direction will be uniform}.
    Therefore the probability distributions for the short jumps $l_0$ and for the long jumps $l_1$ will be

    \begin{equation*}
        l_0\Big((x - x_p), (y - y_p) | U, \sigma \Big)= J \bigg(\frac{1}{2 \pi} \sigma e^{- \sigma r}\bigg)
    \end{equation*}

    \begin{equation*}
        l_1\Big((x - x_p), (y - y_p) | U, c \Big)= J \bigg(\frac{1}{2 \pi} \sqrt{\frac{c}{2 \pi}} \frac{e^{- \frac{c}{ 2 r}}}{r^{3/2}}\bigg)
    \end{equation*}
    where $J$ is the Jacobian and $r$ is the radial distance between the parents nests and the newly founded nests.
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{RIFA Model: Nests Killed as Detected}
    We also make the assumption that \textcolor{PineGreen}{nests are killed as soon as they are detected}, so we introduce an indicator function $I(t_d - t)$ such that

    \begin{equation*}
        I (t_d - t) =
        \begin{cases}
            1, & \mbox{if} \quad t_d -  t> 0 \\
            0, & \mbox{otherwise}
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    where $t_d$ represents the time of detection. 
\end{frame}
    
    
    
    
 \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{RIFA Model: The Intensity Function}
    So \textcolor{PineGreen}{the intensity function will be}
    \begin{equation*}
        \lambda(x, y, t, f) = \sum_{p:f_p < f} r(f - f_p | \zeta) I(t_d - t) p(U | \gamma) l_0(x, y | U, \sigma) l_1(x, y | U, c)
    \end{equation*}
    where we must have $f_p\leq t_d$.
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{RIFA Model: The Intensity Function}
    So \textcolor{PineGreen}{the intensity function will be}
    \begin{equation*}
        \lambda(x, y, t, f) = \sum_{p:f_p < f} r(f - f_p | \zeta) I(t_d - t) p(U | \gamma) l_0(x, y | U, \sigma) l_1(x, y | U, c)
    \end{equation*}
    where we must have $f_p\leq t_d$.
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
\frametitle{RIFA Model: Poisson Cluster Process}
    As demonstrated by Hawkes and Oakes \cite{Hawkes74}, any stationary self-exciting point process with finite intensity may be interpreted as a Poisson cluster process with the number of offspring for each event drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean 

    \begin{equation*}
        m = \int_0^T \iint_S g(x-x', y-y', f-f')\d N(x', y', f').
    \end{equation*}
    The likelihood, or joint pdf, at time $T$, will then be that of an inhomogeneous Poisson process for the founding process with intensity $\lambda(x, y, t)$
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{RIFA Model: Detection Process}
    We will consider the detection processes in parallel with the founding events in a similar way as in Jewell's model for infectious diseases (\cite{Jewell}) : The time from establishment to notification $(t_i - f_i)$ of an offspring nest $i$ is a random variable exponentially distributed with parameter $\varphi$

    \begin{equation*}
    h(t_{i} - f_{i} | \varphi) = \varphi \exp (- \varphi(t_{i} - f_{i})).
    \end{equation*}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{RIFA Model: The Likelihood}
    The Likelihood for a set of $n$ locations $(s_{1}, ... , s_{n})$ with $s_i = (x_i, y_i)$, founding times $f_{1}, ... , f_{n}$, and detection times $(t_{1},  ... , t_{n})$ will then be:
    \begin{equation*} \label{eq:like}
        \begin{aligned}
            L = & \Bigg[ \prod_{i = 1}^{n} \lambda(s_{i}, t_{i}, f_{i}) \Bigg] \exp \Bigg(- \int_{0}^{T} \int_{0}^{T} \int_{S} \lambda(s, t, f) \d s \d t \d f \Bigg) \\ 
            & \prod_{\{ i : t_{i} < T \} } h(t_{i} - f_{i}) \prod_{ \{ i : t_{i} = \infty \} } \int_{T}^{\infty} h(t - f_{i}) \d t
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}
    where $t_{i} = \infty$ if nest $i$ has not been detected at time $T$ and where $n$ is the number of nests founded. The quantity $h(t_{i} - f_{i})$ is the contribution of the observed nests, while $\int_{T}^{\infty} h(t - f_{i}) \d t$ is the contribution of the unobserved nest.
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{RIFA Model: The Likelihood}
    Substituting the function $h$ and evaluating the last integral in equation above we get

    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            L = & \Bigg[ \prod_{i = 1}^{n} \lambda(s_{i}, t_{i}, f_{i}) \Bigg] \exp \bigg(- \zeta \sum_{i=1}^{n} (min\{ T, t_i \} - f_i) \bigg) \\ 
            & \prod_{\{ i : t_{i} < T \} } \varphi \exp (- \varphi (t_{i} - f_{i})) \prod_{ \{ i : t_{i} = \infty \} } \exp \bigg( - \varphi(T - f_{i}) \bigg).
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}
    \textcolor{PineGreen}{Notice that natural deaths are not considered in our model, so nests are immortal until detected and removed.}

        \item define the \textcolor{PineGreen}{time intervals} $\tau_j = (T_{j-1}, T_j]$ where $T_j$ is the time at which we receive a new set of observations.
        \item \textcolor{PineGreen}{The states of this system} at times $T_j$ are represented by random sets $\bm{a}^{T_j} = (a^{T_j}_1, \dots, a^{T_j}_{N^{T_j}}) \in \mathbb{R}^{4\times N^{T_j}}$ where $N^{T_j}$ is the unknown number of nests alive at time $T_j$ and whose elements $a^{T_j}_k = (t_k^{T_j}, f_k^{T_j}, x_k^{T_j}, y_k^{T_j})$ with $k = 1, \dots , N^{T_j}$ represent the nests indexed by $k$ and containing \textcolor{PineGreen}{the time of founding $f_k$, the time of observation $t_k$ corresponding to the time of death, and the coordinates $x_k$ and $y_k$}.

        \item \textcolor{PineGreen}{The observation set} $\bm{z}^{T_i} \in \mathbb{R}^{i \times M^{T_i} \times 3}$ where $M^{T_i}$ is the total number of nests detected up to time $T_i$. The elements $z^{T_j}_l = (t^{T_j}_l, x^{T_j}_l, y^{T_j}_l)$ will contain the time of observation and coordinates of the observed nest indexed by $l$ with $l = 1, \dots, M^{T_j}$. We will also define $\bm{Z}^{T_i} = (\bm{z}^1, \dots, \bm{z}^{T_i})$.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{RIFA Model: The Markovian System}
    \textcolor{PineGreen}{The likelihood defined above $L(\bm{a}^{T_i} | \bm{A}^{T_{i-1}})$ is the density distribution characterising the system and the observations}. Notice that \textcolor{Red}{the model is Markovian}, therefore each $\bm{a}^{T_i}$ is conditionally independent of $\bm{A}^{T_{i-2}} = (\bm{a}^{T_1}, \dots, \bm{a}^{T_{i-2}})$, given $\bm{a}^{T_{i-1}}$ and we will therefore have $L(\bm{a}^{T_i} | \bm{A}^{T_{i-1}}) = L(\bm{a}^{T_i} | \bm{a}^{T_{i-1}})$.
    
    At time $T_1$ the joint prior distribution for $\bm{A}^{T_1}$ will be
    \begin{equation*}
        q(\bm{A}^{T_1}) = L(\bm{a}^{T_1}),
    \end{equation*}
    and for $T_i$ with $i \geq 2$
    \begin{equation*}
        q(\bm{A}^{T_i} | \bm{Z}^{T_{i-1}}) =  \frac{L(\bm{a}^{T_1})}{r(\bm{z}^{T_1})} \prod_{j=2}^{i-1} \frac{L(\bm{a}^{T_j} | \bm{a}^{T_{j-1}})}{r(\bm{z}^{T_j} | \bm{Z}^{T_{j-1}})} \times L(\bm{a}^{T_i} | \bm{a}^{T_{i-1}})
    \end{equation*}
    so \textcolor{PineGreen}{the joint posterior distribution} will be

\begin{frame}{Appendix 1: Proof of the identity in slide \ref{identity}}
    Define a probability measure $\P^*$ having density $p^*$ on $\Omega^*_t$ such that the marginal distribution of $\P^*$ on $\Omega_t'$ is $\P$, that is $\P = \P^* \circ \pi^{-1}$, where $\P$ is the measure with density $p$ on $\Omega_t'$. 

    Here the measurable sets in $\Omega_t$, $\Omega_t'$ and $\Omega_t^*$, are constructed from Borel sets on $\Real^M$ and subsets of $2^M$ in the manner implied by the sequence of cross-products and restrictions used to define $\Omega_t$, $\Omega_t'$ and $\Omega_t^*$. Similarly, reference measures are constructed from Lebesgue measure on $\Real^M$ and counting measure on $2^M$.)

    By the disintegration theorem (see \cite{Rohlin}) there exists a family of measures $\{ \nu_{\bm{(y')}^t} \}_{\bm{(y')}^t \in \Omega'_t}$ on $\Omega^*_t$ such that for every measurable Borel function $m : \Omega^*_t \rightarrow [0, \infty]$
    \begin{align*}
        &\int_{\Omega^*_t} m(\bm{(y')}^t, \bm{y}^t)\diff \P^* = \\
     & \int_{\Omega_t'} \bigg( \int_{\pi^{-1}(\bm{(y')}^t)} m(\bm{(y')}^t, \bm{y}^t) \diff \nu_{\bm{(y')}^t}  \bigg) \diff \P((\bm{y'})^t).
    \end{align*}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
    It follows that for any event $A$,
    \begin{align*}
        &\P(A) = \P^{*}(\pi^{-1}(A)) = \\
        &\int_{\Omega_t^*} I_A(\pi(\bm{(y')}^t, \bm{y}^t)) p^*(\bm{(y')}^t, \bm{y}^t | \bm{Z}^t) \D \P^*  = \\
        & \int_{\Omega_t'} I_A(\bm{(y')}^t) \Bigg[ \int_{\pi^{-1}(\bm{(y')}^t)} p^*(\bm{(y')}^t, \bm{y}^t | \bm{Z}^t) \D \nu_{\bm{(y')}^t} (\bm{y}^t) \Bigg] \D \P (\bm{(y')}^t)
    \end{align*}
    and hence
    \begin{equation*}
        p(\bm{(y')}^t | \bm{Z}^t) = \int_{\pi^{-1}(\bm{(y')}^t)} p^*(\bm{(y')}^t, \bm{y}^t | \bm{Z}^t) \D \nu_{\bm{(y')}^t}(\bm{y}^t).
    \end{equation*}
    Moreover,
    \begin{align*}
        &E_{p}[l(\bm{(y')}^{t})]  = \int_{\Omega_t'} l(\bm{(y')}^{t})\; p(\bm{(y')}^{t} | \bm{Z}^{t}) \D \P (\bm{(y')}^{t}) \\
        &= \int_{\Omega_t'} l(\bm{(y')}^{t})\Bigg[\int_{\pi^{-1}(\bm(y'))} p^*(\bm{(y')}^{t}, \bm{y}^{t} | \bm{Z}^{t}) \D \nu_{\bm{(y')}^t}(\bm{y}^t) \Bigg] \D \P \bm{(y')}^{t} \\ 
        &= \int_{\Omega_t^*} l(\pi(\bm{(y')}^{t}, \bm{y}^{t}))\; p^*(\bm{(y')}^{t}, \bm{y}^{t} | \bm{Z}^{t}) \D \P^*(\bm{(y')}^t, \bm{y}^t) \\ 
        &= E_{p^*}[l(\pi (\bm{(y')}^{t}, \bm{y}^{t}))].
    \end{align*}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Appendix 2: Observations missing at random}
    If $\bm{B}^t$ evolves independently of $\bm{X}^t$we have $\bm{b}^t | \bm{x}^t, \bm{b}^{t-1} \sim g_t(\bm{b}^t | \bm{b}^{t-1})$.
    
    Here we limit our interest to expectations of the form:
    \begin{align*}
        E_{p} \Big[l(\bm{X}^{t}) \Big] &=  \int_{\Omega_t'} l(\bm{X}^{t})\; p(\bm{X}^{t} | \bm{Z}^{t})\; \prod_{ \{ i \leq t  : z^t_{i} = - \} } \D x^i
    \end{align*}
    for functions $l: \Omega_t'  \rightarrow \Real$, where $\Omega_t' := \sigma^{-1}(\bm{Z}^{t})$ as before, remembering that $\bm{B}^{t}$ is fully determined by $\bm{Z}^{t}$, so that elements of $\Omega_t'$ all share the same value of $\bm{B}^{t}$. 

    Since these expectations do not depend on $\bm{B}^t$, the $g$ terms can be brought outside the integrals in the expressions above. Thus all $g$ terms cancel in the expression for $p(\bm{X}^t, \bm{B}^t | \bm{Z}^t)$. Moreover, all $g$ terms except the final term $g(\bm{b}^t | \bm{b}^{t-1})$ cancel in for $q(\bm{X}^t, \bm{B}^t | \bm{Z}^{t-1})$ and this last term may be removed by summing over $\bm{B}^t$. In this case, it will be convenient to redefine $h$ and $r$ as follows:
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        h(\bm{X}^t) & := & f(\bm{x}^1)\prod_{i=2}^{t} f(\bm{x}^i | \bm{x}^{i-1})
    \end{eqnarray*}
    \end{frame}
    
    
    
    
    \begin{frame}
    and
        \begin{eqnarray*}
        r(\bm{Z}^t) & := & \int_{\Omega_t'}  h(\bm{X}^t) \prod_{ \{ i \leq t, m \in \{1, \ldots, M \} : z^t_{im} = - \} } \D x^i_m
    \end{eqnarray*}
    with
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        r(\bm{z}^t | \bm{Z}^{t-1}) & := & \frac{r(\bm{Z}^t)}{r(\bm{Z}^{t-1})}.
    \end{eqnarray*}
    Note the set $\Omega_t'$ also needs to be redefined as the projection of $\sigma^{-1}(\bm{Z}^t)$ onto the subspace obtained by discarding the second element of the pair $(\bm{X}^t,\bm{B}^t)$, noting that $\bm{B}^t$ is the same for all elements of $\sigma^{-1}(\bm{Z}^t)$. With this modified notation, we can now write:
    \[
        q(\bm{X}^1) = f(\bm{x}^1),
    \]
    on $\Omega_1 = \Real^M$ and for $t \geq 2$,
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        q(\bm{X}^t | \bm{Z}^{t-1}) & = & \frac{f(\bm{x}^1)}{r(\bm{z}^1)}  \prod_{i=2}^{t-1} \frac{f(\bm{x}^i | \bm{x}^{i-1}) }{r(\bm{z}^t | \bm{Z}^{t-1})} f(\bm{x}^t | \bm{x}^{t-1})
    \end{eqnarray*}
    on $\Omega_t = \Omega_{t-1}' \times \Real^M $ and 
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        p(\bm{X}^t | \bm{Z}^t) 
        & = & \frac{f(\bm{x}^1)}{r(\bm{z}^1)} \prod_{i=2}^t \frac{f(\bm{x}^i | \bm{x}^{i-1}) }{r(\bm{z}^t | \bm{Z}^{t-1})} 
    \end{eqnarray*}
    on $\Omega_t'$.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
    If $\bm{B}^t$ evolves independently of $\bm{X}^t$, the partial weights simplify to
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        w^{t}_{1j} &=& \frac{f((\bm{x}_j')^1)}{f(\bm{x}_j^1)}
    \end{eqnarray*}
    and
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        w^{t}_{ij} &=& \frac{f((\bm{x}_j')^i | (\bm{x}_j')^{i-1})}{f(\bm{x}_j^i | \bm{x}_j^{i-1})}
    \end{eqnarray*}
    for $i \in \{ 2, \ldots, t-1 \}$. 
    However, the final $g$ term (for $i = t$) does not cancel in general, hence
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        w^{t}_{tj} &=& \frac{f((\bm{x}_j')^t | (\bm{x}_j')^{t-1})}{f(\bm{x}_j^t | \bm{x}_j^{t-1})} \frac{g((\bm{b}_j')^t | \bm{b}_j^{t-1})}{g(\bm{b}_j^t | \bm{b}_j^{t-1})}
    \end{eqnarray*}
    The alternative partial weight $v_{ij}^t$ simplifies similarly (and is again equal to the numerator of $w_{ij}^t$).
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}{Appendix 3: An alternative distribution for $u$}
    An alternative distribution for $u$, is obtained by restricting $q(\bm{y}^{t} | \bm{Z}^{t-1})$ to the set $F(\bm{(y')}^{t})$. In this case, the normalising constant, obtained by integrating $q(\bm{y}^{t} | \bm{Z}^{t-1})$ over $F(\bm{(y')}^{t})$, depends on the specific value of $\bm{(y')}^{t}$. In our examples below it can be evaluated exactly, but in some cases it may require estimation. 
    For this $u$ the normalised weights after cancelling terms are
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        w^{t}_j &=& \frac{\frac{1}{N_j} \prod_{i=1}^t v^{t}_{ij}}{\sum_{l=1}^n \frac{1}{N_l}\prod_{i=1}^t v^{t}_{il}}
    \end{eqnarray*}
    where $N_j$ is the normalisation constant obtained by integrating $q(\bm{y}^{t} | \bm{Z}^{t-1})$ over $F((\bm{y}_j')^{t})$, and the alternative partial weights are given by
    \[
        v^{t}_{1j} = w^{t}_{1j} f(\bm{x}_j^1)g(\bm{b}_j^1 | \bm{x}_j^1) = f((\bm{x}_j')^1)g((\bm{b}_j')^1 | (\bm{x}_j')^1)
    \]
    and
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        v^{t}_{ij} &=& w^{t}_{ij} f(\bm{x}_j^i | \bm{x}_j^{i-1}) g(\bm{b}_j^i | \bm{x}_j^i, \bm{b}_j^{i-1}) \\
        &=& f((\bm{x}_j')^i | (\bm{x}_j')^{i-1}) g((\bm{b}_j')^i | (\bm{x}_j')^i, (\bm{b}_j')^{i-1})
    \end{eqnarray*}
    for $i \geq 2$.
