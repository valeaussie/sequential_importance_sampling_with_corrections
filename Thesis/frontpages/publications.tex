\section*{Publications during enrolment}

{\color{blue}List any publications during enrolment, with a short description. For example
\begin{itemize}
\item Chapter blah$_{1}$ and Chapter blah$_{2}$ are based off joint work with John Chan. The manuscript, titled `A proof that PhD life is unbearable', has been published in a very underwhelming and possibly illegitimate journal. A version is currently on the arXiv under the same name.
\end{itemize}
